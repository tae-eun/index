    <div class="lyrics">
        [Verse 1]<br>
        With all due respect<br>
        I don't have pity for you black niggas, that's the way I feel<br>
        Screamin', "Black Lives Matter"<br>
        All the black guys'd rather be deadbeats than pay your bills<br>
        Yellin', "Nigga," this, and, "Nigga," that<br>
        Call everybody, "Nigga," and get a nigga mad<br>
        As soon as I say, "Nigga," then everyone react<br>
        And wanna swing at me and call me racist 'cause I ain't black<br>
        Well pound that, then<br>
        Talkin' 'bout slavery like you was around back then<br>
        Like you was pickin' cotton off the fuckin' ground back then<br>
        Like you was on the plantation gettin' down back then<br>
        Aight, look<br>
        I see a black man aimin' his gun<br>
        But I'd rather see a black man claimin' his son<br>
        And I don't mean just for one day and you done, I mean<br>
        You still trapped in a rut<br>
        And I work my ass off and pay my taxes for what?<br>
        So you can keep livin' on free government assistance?<br>
        Food stamps for your children, but you still tryna sell 'em<br>
        For some weed and some liquor or a fuckin' babysitter?<br>
        While you party on the road 'cause you ain't got no fuckin' goals?<br>
        You already late<br>
        You motherfuckers need to get your damn priorities straight, wait<br>
        It's like you're proud to be fake<br>
        But you lazy as fuck<br>
        And you'd rather sell drugs than get a job and be straight<br>
        And then you turn around and complain about the poverty rate? Fuck outta my face<br>
        You can't escape problems<br>
        You can pray for some change, but can't break a dollar<br>
        Got nobody else to blame, so you blame Donald<br>
        "They fuck the world with a Make America Great condom"<br>
        My voice been back<br>
        I'm not racist, my sister's boyfriend's black<br>
        I'm not racist, my sister-in-law's baby cousin Tracy got a brother and his girlfriend's black<br>
        My head's in the cloud<br>
        Heard there's not enough jobs for all the men in your house<br>
        Maybe we should build a wall to keep the Mexicans out<br>
        Or maybe we should send 'em all to the ghetto for now<br>
        I'm not racist, and I never lie<br>
        But I think there's a disconnect between your culture and mine<br>
        I worship the Einsteins, study the Steve Jobs<br>
        But you ride 2Pac's dick like he was a fuckin' god, oh my God<br>
        And all you care about is rappin' and stuntin' and bein ratchet, and that's the nigga within you<br>
        Music rottin' your brain and slowly start to convince you<br>
        Then you let your kids listen and then the cycle continues<br>
        Blame it all on the menu, blame it on those drinks<br>
        Blame it on everybody except for your own race<br>
        Blame it on white privileges, blame it on white kids<br>
        And just blame it on white citizens, aim at the vice president<br>
        Bunch of class clowns<br>
        Niggas kneelin' on the field, that's a flag down<br>
        How dare you try to make demands for this money?<br>
        You gon' show us some respect, you gon' stand for this country, nigger<br>
    </div>
    <div class="lyrics">
        I'm not racist, I'm just prepared for this type of war<br>
        I heard Eminem's rap at the awards, who's he fightin' for?<br>
        Y'all can take that motherfucker too, he ain't white no more<br>
        It's like you wanna be so famous<br>
        You'll do anything for attention and a little payment<br>
        I can't take you nowhere without people pointin' fingers<br>
        Pants hangin' off your ass, you ain't got no home trainin'?<br>
        Pull your fuckin' pants up, nigga<br>
        Put that suit back on, take that durag off<br>
        Take that gold out your mouth, quit the pitiful stuff<br>
        And then maybe police'd stop killin' you fucks, yo, what the fuck?<br>
        I'm not racist<br>
        It's like we're livin' in the same building, but split into two floors<br>
        I'm not racist<br>
        But there's two sides to every story, I wish that I knew yours<br>
        I wish that I knew yours<br>
        I'm not racist, I swear<br>
        <br>
        [Verse 2]<br>
        With all disrespect<br>
        I don't really like you white motherfuckers, that's just where I'm at<br>
        Screaming, "All Lives Matter," is a protest to my protest, what kind of shit is that?<br>
        And that's one war you'll never win<br>
        The power in the word, "Nigga," is a different sin<br>
        We shouldn't say it, but we do, and that's just what it is<br>
        But that don't mean that you can say it just 'cause you got nigga friends<br>
        Nigga<br>
        That word was originated for you to keep us under<br>
        And when we use it, we know that's just how we greet each other<br>
        And when you use it, we know there's a double meaning under<br>
        And even if I wasn't picking cotton physically<br>
        That don't mean I'm not affected by the history<br>
        My grandmama was a slave, that shit gets to me<br>
        And you ain't got no motherfuckin' sympathy, you pussy nigga<br>
        I'm sorry, you can never feel my life<br>
        Tryna have faith, but I never felt alright<br>
        It's hard to elevate when this country's ran by whites<br>
        Judging me by my skin color and my blackness<br>
        Tryna find a job but ain't nobody call me back yet<br>
        Now I gotta sell drugs to put food in my cabinet<br>
        You crackers ain't slick, this is all a part of your tactics<br>
        Don't talk about no motherfuckin' taxes<br>
        When I ain't making no dough<br>
        You think you know everything, but you don't<br>
        You wanna copy our slang and everything that we know<br>
        Try to steal black culture and then make it your own, woah<br>
        Fuck, I'm exhausted<br>
        I can't even drive without the cops tryna start shit<br>
        I'm tired of the systematic racism bullshit<br>
        All you do is false shit, this the shit that I'm forced with<br>
        And you don't know shit about my people, that's what bothers you<br>
        You don't know about no fried chicken or no barbecue<br>
        You don't know about the two-step or no loose change<br>
        You don't know about no 2 Chainz or no Kool-Aid, you don't know<br>
        And even though Barack was half as black<br>
        You hated President Obama, I know that's a fact<br>
        You couldn't wait to get him out and put a cracker back<br>
        And then you gave us Donald Trump and now it's payback for that<br>
        I'm not racist, I never lied<br>
        But I know there's a disconnect between your culture and mines<br>
        Yeah, I praise 2Pac like he was a fuckin' god<br>
        He was fighting for his life way before he fuckin' died, nigga, die, nigga<br>
        And all you care about is money and power and being ugly and that's the cracker within you<br>
        Hatred all in your brain, it slowly start to convince you<br>
        And then you teach it to your children until the cycle continue<br>
        Blame it on Puerto Rico, blame it on OJ<br>
        Blame it on everybody except for your own race<br>
        Blame it on black niggas and blame it on black citizens<br>
        Aim at the black businesses, I ain't saying I'm innocent, but<br>
        I might be any day now<br>
        Treatin' everybody how you want and any way how<br>
        I swear North Korea 'bout to bomb us any day now<br>
        And now I'm duckin' every time I hear a fuckin' plane now, shit<br>
        You know I make a lot of sense, but you just can't admit it<br>
        When Eminem went against Trump, that was the illest<br>
        'Cause even though he's white, he let us know he standin' with us<br>
        I'm not racist, but I cry a lot<br>
        You don't know what it's like to be in a frying pot<br>
        You don't know what it's like to mind your business<br>
        And get stopped by the cops and not know if you 'bout to die or not<br>
        You worry 'bout your life, so you take mine<br>
        I love you, but I fuckin' hate you at the same time<br>
        I wish we could trade shoes or we could change lives<br>
        So we could understand each other more, but that'd take time<br>
        I'm not racist<br>
        It's like we livin' in the same building, but split into both sides<br>
        I'm not racist<br>
        But there's two sides to every story and now you know mine<br>
